"This uncertainty, referred to as model selection uncertainty, forms one of the greatest sources of uncertainty for predictive modeling."

However, this existing paradigm is rapidly being stretched to its limits because
of dramatic growth in scientific data; e.g., collecting billions of particle
collisions [20], simulating thousands of climate scenarios [21], or observing
millions of stars [22].

Chapter 1.

"How robust is a certain solution; e.g., how might slightly different data or
the addition of noise change the results? How rigorously have the assumptions and
underlying theories been defined and validated?  For classical techniques, such as
analyzing PDE-based models, these questions lead to familiar concepts,
including well-posedness, stability, numerical approximation, and UQ."

Section 2.4

"Data used to train ML models are often noisy, uncertain, incomplete, sparse,
and only partly informative.  Similarly, ML models themselves are subject to
uncertainty in their general form,  internal  structure,  and  associated
parameters."

"Despite the stated benefits, some challenges often increase upon setting the ML
problem in a probabilistic context.  These include increased dimensionality from
probabilistic modeling, the need  to  deal  with  high  computational  costs  in
UQ  sampling  strategies,  and  the  need  for  adequate error modeling in data
and models. "

"Both the statistical inverse problem (PML model training) and the forward UQ
problem (propagating uncertainty to ML model predictions) can become quite
expensive in high-dimensional complex ML models."


2.6    Intelligent Automation and Decision Support

Inner loop means forward simulation, outer loop means optimizing or tuning
properties given by the inner loop.


Appendix A

"However, in practice, there are many sources of uncertainty, including not only
the data used to inform ML but also issues in the sensitivity of the underlying
model space and the effect on the extent it is even possible to make predictions.
These issues contribute to  uncertainty  in  the  conclusions  suggested  by  ML
and  it  is  vital  that  the  decision  makers  are provided with information,
ideally quantitative, regarding the uncertainty."

US Department of Energy
Advanced Scientific Computing Advisory Committee (ASCAC)
Subcommittee on AI/ML, Data-intensive Science and High-Performance
Computing
Final Draft of Report to the Committee, September 2020


"AI  methods  need  to  have  provable  correctness  and  performance,  be  able
to  expose biases, and to quantify uncertainties, errors, and precision"

Recommends creating an "AI  for  Science" initiative.

One of the four components is "AI algorithms and foundational research".

Section 6.2: AI applications

"Efficiently extract critical & strategic information from large, complex
datasets." ..." These include: whether an algorithm trained on one dataset can be
used  to  produce  reliable  answers  about a  different dataset;  whether  a
particular algorithm is  robust against  noise  or  attempts  to  deceive it;
what the  basis  is  for  the answers an algorithm provides and whether these
answers are free of bias."


"Build  AI  based  higher  order  integrated biological models  that fully
capture  the complexity of interactions and lead to a predictive understanding of
biological systems"


"Priority Research Directions: High Energy Physics (HEP)"

3. Design tools to quantify the impact of systematic effects of the accuracy and
stability of complex ML models.

"Uncertainty Quantification  (UQ) is  imperative  for  physical  measurements.
While  AI  algorithms  have  proliferated,  general  techniques  for
understanding  their  accuracy  and  stability in complex environments have not.
If these techniques are to become fully useful in  deriving  measured
quantities,  work  is  needed  in  this  area  to  develop  models  whose
uncertainties can be described in a manner appropriate to the measurement."


Nuclear Physics:

"While traditional ML tools may be applied to these problems, significant
effort is required in the careful tuning of ML tools (hyperparameter
determination) to optimize performance in each application domain."
