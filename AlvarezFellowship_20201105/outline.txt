- Complex statistical models are important for complex problems
- But inference is more demanding, and classical techniques massively increase
the computational cost relative to a single fit.
  - Need to propagate uncertainty among components (MCMC, Celeste)
  - Need to tune / check predictive accuracy (CV, mice genes)
  - Need to interrogate modeling assumptions (priors, BNP for human genomes)
- I apply sensitivity analysis to all three of these problems and more,
allowing accurate approximation with theoretical bounds from a single model
fit.
- Sensitivity analysis is based on a Taylor series approximation.  Many
of the ideas I explore have long theoretical histories.  My work revisits
these ideas in the context of modern problems and automatic differentiation,
updating the theory as necessary.
