\begin{block}{Standard error consistency theorm: (sketch)}

For Bayesian hierarchical logictic regression, define
$$
\varepsilon_n = \y_n - \expect{\post}{\m(\x_n^\trans \theta)}
\quad\textrm{and}\quad
\psi_n := \Nsur \w_n^\mrp \varepsilon_n.
$$

We state mild conditions under which, as $N \rightarrow \infty$,
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \sqrt{N}\left(\muhat_\mrp - \mu_\infty \right) \rightarrow{}&
    \mathcal{N}\left(0, V\right) \quad\textrm{for some $\mu_\infty$ and variance $V$, and}\\
\meansur (\psi_n - \overline{\psi})^2 \rightarrow{}& V.
\end{aligned}
$$
\end{block}

The use of $\w_n^\mrp$ is exactly analogous to the use of raking weights
for standard error estimation.

This builds on our earlier work on the Bayesian
infinitesimal jackknife\footcite{giordano:2024:bayesij}.
