% Several factors drive the disagreement:
%
\hrule
\begin{itemize}
\item The problem is very hard (it's difficult to accurately poll non--voters)
\item Different data sources
%
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Blue Rose aggregates its own private data
%     \item The \emph{On Data and Democracy} posts use public data, e.g.~the
%           cooperative election study (CES)
% \end{itemize}
%
\item $\star$$\star$$\star$ \textbf{Different statistical methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Blue Rose uses Bayesian hierarchical modeling (MrP)
    \item On Data and Democracy is using calibration weighting (CW)
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Our contribution}
    We define ``MrP local equivalent weights'' (MrPlew) that:
    %
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are easily computable from MCMC draws and standard software, and
    \item Provide MrP versions of key diagnostics that motivate calibration weighting.
\end{itemize}
%
\textbf{$\Rightarrow$ MrPlew provides direct comparisons between
MrP and calibration weighting.}
