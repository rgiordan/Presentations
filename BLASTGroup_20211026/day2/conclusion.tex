\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
%
\item Variational inference can be thought of as \emph{approximate marginalization using optimization}.
%
\item Not only is variational inference closely related to familiar existing
frequentist methods (like the EM algorithm), it can help us understand those
methods better.
%
\item The key to a good variational approximation is \emph{tractable
expectations}, \emph{tractable entropy}, and \emph{expressivity}.
%
\item It is important to be aware of variational inference's shortcomings (e.g.,
underestimation of variance in the mean field approximation).
%
\item There are a zillion topics to work on in variational inference.
A good place to start reading is \citet{blei2017variational}.
