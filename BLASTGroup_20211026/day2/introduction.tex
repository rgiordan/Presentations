Outline for today:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What counts as variational inference?
    \item Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and ``standard'' variational inference
    \item The classical EM algorithm as a special case of variational inference
    \item Variational inference as a generalization of the EM algorithm
    \item Some examples of VI in practice
\end{itemize}
