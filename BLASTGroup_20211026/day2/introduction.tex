Outline for today:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Some examples of latent variable models
    \item A template: The Neyman-Scott ``paradox'' and marginalization
    \item Bayesian versus frequentist approaches to marginalization
    \item The classical EM algorithm (in brief)
    % \item The EM algorithm as variational inference
\end{itemize}

Next week, we will build on these ideas to present more general variational
inference.
