...or why don't we always use the maximum likelihood estimator?

\hrulefill

Here's a toy model.  For some unknown $z_n$ and $\theta$, draw

\begin{align*}
    y_{na} | z_n, \theta \sim{}& \mathcal{N}(z_n, \theta)\\
    y_{nb} | z_n, \theta \sim{}& \mathcal{N}(z_n, \theta)
\end{align*}


\begin{align*}
    \textrm{Observations: }y ={}& (y_{11}, y_{1b}, \ldots, y_{Na}, y_{Nb})\\
    \textrm{Unknown latent variables: }z ={}& (z_1, \ldots, y_N)\\
    \textrm{Unknown global parameter: }\theta \in \mathbb{R}
\end{align*}

Task: infer $\theta$.

\begin{align*}
    y_{na} | z_n, \theta \sim{} \mathcal{N}(z_n, \theta) \quad\quad\quad
    y_{nb} | z_n, \theta \sim{} \mathcal{N}(z_n, \theta)
\end{align*}

Let's use that old workhorse, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)!

(\textbf{Spoiler:} Something will go wrong.)

The normal distribution gives (up to constants):

%
\begin{align*}
%
\log p(y_{na}, y_{nb} | \theta, z_n) ={}&
-\frac{1}{2} \theta^{-1} \left( y_{na}  - z_n\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2}log \theta
&-\frac{1}{2} \theta^{-1} \left( y_{nb}  - z_n\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2}\log \theta
%
\end{align*}
%

\begin{align*}
%
\log p(y | \theta, z) ={}&
\sum_{n=1}^N \log p(y_{na}, y_{nb} | \theta, z_n)
%
\end{align*}
%

The MLE is given by:

%
\begin{align*}
%
\hat\theta, \hat{z} :={}& \argmax_{\theta, z}  \log p(y | \theta, z)
\quad\quad\Leftrightarrow{}\quad\quad
\fracat{\partial \log p(y | \theta, z)}{\partial (\theta, z)}{\thetahat, \hat{z}} ={} 0
%
\end{align*}
%

\textbf{Exercise:} Find an expression for $\hat{z}_n$.

={}& - \thetahat^{-1} (y_{na}  - \hat{z}_n)
    - \thetahat^{-1} (y_{nb}  - \hat{z}_n) \Rightarrow \\
\hat{z}_n ={}& \frac{1}{2}(y_{na} + y_{nb}).

\end{align*}

Wonderful!  This is a very sensible expression, and it doesn't depend on
$\thetahat$.

\begin{align*}
\hat{z_n} &= \frac{1}{2}(y_{na} + y_{nb}) \\
\thetahat &\plim \frac{\theta_0}{2} \ne \theta_0
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
    %
\item Our estimates for the latent variables $\hat{z}_n$ are quite uncertain (they use only
two observaitons each)
%
\item But our MLE estimate for $\thetahat$ treated the $\hat{z}_n$ as if they
were known exactly
%
\item $\Rightarrow$ We estimated less dispersion around $\hat{z}_n$ than was
truly present.  That is, we \emph{under-estimated} $\theta_0$.
%
\item To avoid this problem, we must account for the uncertainty in $\z_n$
when estimating $\theta$.
%
\end{itemize}

Solution: \textbf{Marginalization.}
