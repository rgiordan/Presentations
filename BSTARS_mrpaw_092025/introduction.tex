        And because less-engaged voters swung away from [Democrats], an expanded
        electorate meant a more Republican electorate.''

% Several factors drive the disagreement:
%
\hrule
\begin{itemize}
\item The problem is very hard (it's difficult to accurately poll non--voters)
\item Different data sources
%
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Blue Rose aggregates its own private data
%     \item The \emph{On Data and Democracy} posts use public data, e.g.~the
%           cooperative election study (CES)
% \end{itemize}
%
\item \textbf{Very different statistical methods:} $\star$
\begin{itemize}
    \item Blue Rose uses Bayesian hierarchical modeling (MrP)
    \item The CES uses weighted averages (calibration weighting)
\end{itemize}
%
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Our contribution}
    We provide a calibration weighting interpretation of MrP analyses that:
    %
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is easily computable from MCMC draws and standard software, and
    \item Defines MrP versions of the diagnostics that motivate calibration weighting.
\end{itemize}
%
Our ``MrP approximate weights'' (MrPaw) admit apples-to-apples comparisons between
these very different methodologies.
%
\end{block}
% \textbf{Our work won't resolve the dispute.}  (Anyway, we'd need access to Blue Rose's private
% data and modeling to even try.)

% But we can form a like--to--like comparison between the methodologies.  (And hope that
% Blue Rose tries our software package.)
