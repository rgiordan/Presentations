\begin{frame}{Experiment}

Show using the Alexander experiment that
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item The MrPaw approximation is accurate, even up to a standard deviation away
    \item Differential imbalance actually exists between raking and MrP and we can detect it
    \item We can make binary datasets for the changes, and there's variability in how to do that
\end{itemize}
%
Remind that we can do frequentist variance and partial pooling too.

\begin{frame}{Future work and generalizations}
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instance of a very general class of local consistency checks that generalize
          classical regression checks (work with Sequoia)
    \item Versions for GLMMs (work with Vladimir)
    \item Going beyond classical Bayesian sensitivity (work with Lucas)
\end{itemize}
