\question{What about when parts of the posterior don't concentrate?}

Example: \textbf{Poisson model with random effects (REs)
$\lambda$ and fixed effect $\gamma$.}

If the observations per random effect remains bounded as $N \rightarrow
\infty$, then

\begin{tabular}{ll}
    Parameter $\lambda$ grows in dimension with $N$.& 
    Parameter $\gamma$ is a scalar. \\
    Marginally, $\p(\lambda \vert \xvec)$ does not concentrate. &
    Marginally, $\p(\gamma \vert \xvec)$ concentrates. \\
\end{tabular}

% (Note $\p(\lambda \vert \xvec)$ does not concentrate.)}

% \textbf{Not in general. }
% Since $\p(\lambda \vert \xvec)$ doesn't concentrate, both the slope $\blue{\infl_n}$ and

\theorem{
\textbf{Theorem 5 of \citet{giordano:2023:bayesij}  (paraphrase): } In general, \textbf{no!}\\
%
Specifically, if $p(\lambda \vert \xvec, \gamma)$ does not concentrate, then \\
--- even if $\p(\gamma \vert \xvec)$ concentrates marginally --- \\
% in the linear approximation to $\expect{\p(\gamma \vert \xvec, \w_n)}{f(\gamma)}$,
both the slope $\blue{\infl_n}$ and the error $\red{\err(\w_n)}$ are $O_p(N^{-1})$, and so \\
$N (\expect{\p(\gamma \vert \xvec, \w_n)}{f(\gamma)} - \expect{\p(\gamma \vert \xvec)}{f(\gamma)}) 
= \blue{N \infl_n (\w_n - 1)} + \red{N \err(\w_n)}$ is nonlinear.
