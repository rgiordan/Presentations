      "A surge on the community levels map requires an extremely high level of COVID transmission in the community (has required higher levels over time as at home tests become a bigger portion of tests and are missed by the counts/people go to hospitals less with COVID and the community levels map, unlike the transmission map does not include a second test positivity measure of estimated transmission to check this failing).  Making masks optional in those conditions with our hybrid indoor/outdoor environment, close outdoor spaces, and toddler population (while having no greater surveillance testing requirement) would be needlessly reckless and would expose community members and especially teachers to substantially increased risks of contracting covid and suffering a growing list of complications and heightened lifetime risks for severe outcomes (including strokes, long COVID, and prolonged respiratory  issues). \n",
      "\n",
      "Admittedly, this is recklessness our public health officials are willing to broadly abide.  Far from being confidence inspiring or the height of reasonableness, to date, the practice of “deferring to the state public health experts,” narrowly defined as being willing to abide state mandates and live in the policy environment state authorities have settled upon, has the confidence inspiring track record of getting more than a million people in our country killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We still have so many babies who cannot vaccinate, pregnant mothers for whom early indications suggest catching COVID even when vaccinated will greatly increase their chances of stillbirths, older community members, and average adults in the 40s and 50s who being average in the US are at already heightened risk of heart and stroke complication and are the demographic COVID has already taken the most life years from if not lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we have had outdoor community transmission at CCC in the limited optional windows we had during the surge periods that Community Levels maps are late to catch but that would have been caught by the Community Transmission map which is why we adopted it.  \n",

      "This is why I would prefer policy B to A.  I am not a mask fetishist but I do care about the risks of transmission and being timely responsive to those risks.   \n",

      "Basically, community levels are severely flawed and take substantial community transmission well in excess of what the CDC continues to flag as levels creating a high risk of transmission (in its transmission maps) to flag yellow and red community levels.  They are less preferably, but more reasonably and acceptably to me, used as proposed here when yellow or red trigger countermeasures and not just red which relies on hospitalizations, a lagging indicator, no matter how bad transmission gets to trigger the change from yellow to red.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I also am happy to rely more on testing to lighten the masking burden on families whom I acknowledge have felt it greatly.  I do think surveillance testing works best as a concept where community COVID detection (for example the detection of one or more CCC kids or parents with COVID near participation/attendance) leads to masking for the community not only for those who happen to test positive, because gaps in days and proximate community members mean positive tests are indicative of uncaught exposure and risks in the community and because individualizing the response to detected COVID in our CCC community makes the mask/test trade off between reduced verifiability (versus visible masks) and heightened surveillance testing at the community level less tilted towards positive aspects of relying on testing in lieu of mask mandates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insisting on Policy D in the face of the other options here, would be the equivalent of saying even when COVID is everywhere and people are clogging up hospitals on a new variant, we don’t want to even test our kids more regularly with community provided tests before sending them into the school unmasked—putting them, their fellow students, their teachers and parents who care for them (and help them with their masks between outside and inside and regularly get spat and sneezed on in providing intimate and proximate assistance that toddlers require) and their families at greater risk.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think that is actually what anyone would feel or think in those circumstances (which we have gotten a little away from as conditions have improved) but I would worry a lot about it being the policy baseline, particularly as we can’t move fast enough as a community to respond to these kinds of circumstances as I think we would largely want to in those conditions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, while i don’t feel uncomfortable with the risk that allowing masking to be optional outside poses in most circumstances, and while I get where people are coming from in saying we should be comfortable “deferring to professionals” on outside masking when we are still using rules like the indoor mask rule which make us safer.  I think that position (as opposed to making masks optional everywhere unless the state mandates them which from prior surveys and community comments in this process, I take not to be a particularly popular position) holds the seeds of recognition that we can and should be doing better than blindly following state policies. \n",
      "\n",
      "So when I say Policy D is unacceptable, I don’t mean I think it is unreasonable for people to endorse or that I feel it would lead to unacceptable risks for me and my family beyond what we are ready to take on for ourselves or cause me to pull out of the school. \n",
      "\n",
      "I mean it mean it in the way that I mean that the million deaths in our country have been unacceptable, not a fact I am unwilling to face or live with, just prevailing terribleness and readiness not to try and do better despite it being relatively easy to improve on mask-optional outside as policy option and address the bulk of the risk associated with unmasking during high transmission periods.  Basically, in the abstract and against a broader backdrop of how terribly society had managed this issue not an unacceptable outcome or policy for a school to adopt, but in context with the options we have on the table and in light of voiced community concerns an availability of the other options here, we should do better. \n",

As an incoming family this year, this well thought out policy was one of the main reasons we chose CCC along of course with the community aspect and wonderful teachers. As a family who is confident in the current policy and feels it is a responsible and scientifically grounded approach, we are deeply concerned that this uprising has brought dissonance among the community and has made it *not* an option to maintain a policy that utilizes the transmission map AND require appropriate masks during a high surge. Our family does not feel safe about families opting out of masking during a high surge. We feel this omission as a policy option is incredibly frustrating. In our opinion, It does not feel reasonable or responsible to expect families to test with antigen testing twice a week during high surges and have that trackable, given resources, and we’re very concerned about transmission at the school given these new rules. \n",

I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend the office hours at which that language was changed. We will almost certainly seek a medical exemption for Frida as soon as it is possible. FYI about our family, our adults mask indoors in public, and we have Frida wear masks in stores/ for short periods of directly supervised time. However, she is obviously not a good fit for several hours of masking due to fingering, chewing, and drooling.

      "We will not be the first school to unmask outdoors; in fact, we are closer to being the last one to do so in Berkeley. May I ask what is everyone’s plan for Kindergarten? Will all the children be homeschooled? Why are we acting like CCC is the only world in which every community member lives in? Every adult encounters countless unmasked people, indoors and outdoors, on a daily basis, unless one only ventures outside of the home to go to CCC. Everyone has the choice to keep their mask on. \n",

      "Though I love many aspects of CCC, I cannot recommend CCC as a preschool to anyone I know because of how out of step CCC is on its COVID masking policies, and how torturous the decision-making process around them has been. \n",

      "I think we should be moving closer to CADPH recommendations, thus prefer the community levels map. My only concern with this, is that there is no clear path under the current options for masking to be optional indoors. If low community levels still requires indoor masking, at what point will this become optional? \n"
