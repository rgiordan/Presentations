\begin{frame}{Problem statement}

We all want to do accurate Bayesian inference quickly:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item In terms of compute (wall time, model evaluations, parallelism)
    \item In terms of analyst effort (tuning, algorithmic complexity)
\end{itemize}
%
\textbf{Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)} can be
straightforward and accurate but slow.

\textbf{Black Box Variational Inference (BBVI)} can be faster alternative to MCMC.
%
\textbf{But...}

%
\begin{itemize}
    \item BBVI is cast as an optimization problem with an intractable objective $\Rightarrow$
    \item Most BBVI methods use \textbf{stochastic gradient} (SG) optimization $\Rightarrow$
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SG algorithms can be hard to tune
        \item Assessing convergence and stochastic error can be difficult
        \item SG optimization can perform worse than second-order methods on tractable objectives
    \end{itemize}
    %
    \item Many BBVI methods employ a \textbf{mean-field (MF) approximation} $\Rightarrow$
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Posterior variances are poorly estimated
    \end{itemize}
    %
\end{itemize}
%
\vspace{-0.5em}
\hrulefill

\textbf{Our proposal:}
replace the intractable BBVI objective with a fixed approximation.
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Better optimization methods can be used (e.g. true second-order methods)
    \item Convergence and approximation error can be assessed directly
    \item Can correct posterior covariances with linear response covariances
    \item This technique is well-studied (but still work to do in the context of BBVI)
\end{itemize}
%
$\Rightarrow$
\textbf{Simpler, faster, and better BBVI posterior approximations ... in some cases.}
