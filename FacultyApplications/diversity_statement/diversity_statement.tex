%\maketitle




As someone with considerable social privelege, my responsibility in the
promotion of a more just, equitable, and inclusive society is to act in response
to expressed, felt need.  Doing so requires cultivating an environment where
people feel safe expressing their needs and struggles sincerely, listening with
humility, and supporting them according to their express wishes.


\paragraph{Expressed, Felt Need.}
%
Padre Greg of the San Lucas Tolim√°n mission in Guatemala taught me a wonderful
phrase which, to me, encapsulates the importance of listening.  Padre Greg
described to us volunteers his story arriving in Guatemala as a young priest
with all sorts of plans to improve the lives of his parishioners, only to learn
the difficult lesson that his ideas were not always the best. Over the years, he
aquired the wisdom to act only in response to ``expressed, felt need,'' meaning
need which is spoken openly, not guessed at, and which is sincerely felt, not
based on the expectations of the powerful.

% One aspect of privelege is having one's opinion taken seriously by default.
% Consequently, even well-intentioned priveleged people can do harm by
% aggressively promoting \emph{their} solutions, rather than listening with
% humility to the needs and experience of under-priveleged.  Coming into contact
% with expressed, felt need requires real effort.
As a Peace Corps volunteer in Kazakhstan, I witnessed extreme versions of
institutional failures to listen. For example, an NGO provided the elementary
school I worked in with an expensive computed lab.  When the NGO representative
visited (once, for a single day), the lab was unlocked, and a show lesson was
put on for their benefit.  Otherwise, the computers sat entirely unused for many
reasons, including for fear of their being broken, for lack of teachers to teach
computer skills, and for lack of time in the government-mandated curriculum.

As an example of listening that I consider successful, I was asked by the
Statistics Department at UC Berkeley to serve on a student panel on increasing
diversity and representation in the department.  Those of us on the panel had
clear ideas of what would help, but, by their nature, such panels usually
consist of graduate students who are already succeeding. Recognizing this bias
in ourselves, we took it upon ourselves to coduct open-ended interviews with all
the grad students in the department to ask what would improve the UC Berkeley
grad school experience, especially for under-represented minorities and women.
The results were eye-opening.  None of the panel's original ideas (such as a
student paper seminar) were very popular, but there was broad and vocal support
for other reforms (such as clearer requirements for the qualifying exam), and .
The work to collate responses not only exposed weakness in our own assumptions,
it also signaled to the department that we were serious enough about diversity
to do a considerable amout of work, and provided numerical support to bolster
our recommendations.

\paragraph{Taking action.}
%
University faculty can take action to promote equity and justice within the
university in at least two qualitatively distinct ways.  One is through personal
relationships, such as via mentorship, advising, and teaching.  The other is
through official programs, such as departmental outreach or diversity events.

I believe that personal relationships are the best opportunity for real social
change, and university faculty have the opportunity to forge many meaningful
relationships with students.  Everything begins with listening, and professors
can often provide a lot of help simply by acting as empathetic sounding boards
for struggling students.  The principal factor that is negatively associated
with URM dropout is a community, and professors can help ensure that students,
especially under-represnted students, feel they have somewhere helpful to turn
when they struggle.  For example, one of the initiatives that came out of the
aforementioned UC Berkeley diversity panel was a strengthened student mentorship
program, which I actively participated in as a mentor.

Finally, I believe that official programs to promote diversity, such as
department panels, outreach programs, and diversity events are best led by the
group whom they are intended to serve.  However, the privelged can often play a
useful subordinate role.  In response to the Geroge Marcy sexual harassment
scandal at UC Berkeley, two female PhD students in statistics wanted to organize
a department-wide ``diversity lunch'' to discuss issues related to sexism in the
statistics field, and they asked me to help.  Importantly, the impetus and key
decisions were entirely theirs.  I could of course provide material help
(emailing, gathering resources, presenting, etc.). But my active presence served
an additional purpose: to signal that sexism was not simply a ``women's issue,''
but a problem that affects and should engage everyone.
