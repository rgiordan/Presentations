Each of the different branches is available in the repository. Once you
have cloned the default repository, you can download all branch and
switch between them like:

  git pull --all
  git checkout color_style2

To get a list of all branches, you can do:

  git branch -a

The branches should include three color and three black and white modes
which you can switch between using "git checkout":

  bw_style1
  bw_style2
  bw_style3
  color_style1
  color_style2
  color_style3
