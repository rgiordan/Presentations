\opening{Dear Recipient,}
This a template for writing letters using the PSB LaTeX templates.  There
are three new document classes, one for each letter template, called
"mitletter1", "mitletter2", and "mitletter3" respectively.

First, one must modify each of the class files "mitletter1.cls",
"mitletter2.cls", and "mitletter3.cls" so that his/her personal
information is set.  The parameters to change are: Office Name, Room
Number, Phone Number, Fax Number, website, E-mail, name, and title.  The
last two parameters (name and title) are called "person" and "ID" within
the class files.

Next, to compose a letter, one must: set the document class to one of the
above document classes, specify a name and (optionally) a signature, and
then proceed with writing the letter as if it were a standard letter.

The MIT logo is included as an encapsulated PostScript file (EPS) and,
as a result, will only display correctly using dvips. Many people now
use pdflatex intead. pdflatex will require that the logo be converted
from EPS to PDF which can be done using ImageMagick or several other
programs.

\closing{Sincerely}

\end{letter}
