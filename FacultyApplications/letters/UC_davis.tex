\def\deptspecific{I believe that my work in statistical methodology for
large-scale and complex problems and my strong history of interdisciplinary data
science makes this position at UC Davis a particularly good fit for me.
Additionally, I believe that my experience in and enthusiasm for teaching data
science, both at the introductory and graduate level, will allow me to
contribute meaningfully to the new data science and machine learning teaching
curricula at UC Davis.}
