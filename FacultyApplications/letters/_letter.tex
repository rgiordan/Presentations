Dear \whom,

\vspace{1em}
I am writing to apply for the position of \position.

\vspace{1em} I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with Prof.\ Tamara
Broderick at the Massachussets Institute of Technology's Laboratory for
Information and Decision Systems, where I study the robustness of frequentist
and Bayesian statistical procedures, both theoretically and with applications
including single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, development economics, and a
MURI-grant funded analysis of oceanic drifter data.  I received my PhD in
statistics from the University of California at Berkeley under the supervision
of Prof.\ Michael Jordan, Prof.\ Jon McAuliffe, and Prof.\ Tamara Broderick.
Additionally, I have earned an MSc with distinction in econometrics from the
London School of Economics and BS degrees in mathematics and engineering
mechanics with honors from the University of Illinois at Urbana--Champaign.
My work history includes four years as an engineer at Google and two
years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Kazakhstan.
