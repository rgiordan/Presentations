\def\position{
Assistant Professor of Statistics and Data Science at the
University of California, Berkeley}

\def\deptspecific{I believe that the interdisciplinary objectives of the
Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society aligns closely with my research
in statistical methodology for large-scale, complex problems, as well as with my
strong history of interdisciplinary data science in both industry and academia.
My tenure as a fellow in the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, my work
developing a data science component for the UC Berkeley graduate curriculum, my
years of experience as an engineer at Google, and my many research
collaborations with domain experts from both the physical and social sciences
all demonstrate my capacity to help advance the discipline of data science
at UC Berkeley.}
