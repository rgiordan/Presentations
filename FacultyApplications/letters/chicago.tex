\def\position{Assistant Professor of Data Science at the University of Chicago}

\def\deptspecific{I believe that the mission of the University of Chicago's Data
Science Institute (DSI) aligns closely with my research in statistical
methodology for large-scale, complex problems, as well as with my strong history
of interdisciplinary data science in both industry and academia.  My tenure as a
fellow in the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, my work developing a data
science component for the UC Berkeley graduate curriculum, my years of
experience as an engineer at Google, and my many research collaborations with
domain experts from both the physical and social sciences all demonstrate my
capacity to advance the DSI's goals of research, outreach, and education.}
