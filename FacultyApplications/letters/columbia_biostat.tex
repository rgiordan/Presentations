\def\deptspecific{I believe that my work on computational statistics and machine
learning, particularly my work developing variational methods for large genomics
datasets, together with my strong history of interdisciplinary research, make
the Columbia University Biostatistics department a particularly good fit for me.
The opportunity to contribute to a better world through genomics and precision
medicine is very exciting.}
