\def\deptspecific{I believe that the mission of the Harvard Data Science
Initiative (HDSI) aligns closely with my research in statistical methodology for
large-scale, complex problems, as well as with my strong history of
interdisciplinary data science in both industry and academia.  My tenure as a
fellow in the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, my work developing a data
science component for the UC Berkeley graduate curriculum, my years of
experience as an engineer at Google, and my many research collaborations with
domain experts from both the physical and social sciences all demonstrate my
capacity to advance the HDSI's goals of rigor, reproducibility, and contextual
understanding. }
