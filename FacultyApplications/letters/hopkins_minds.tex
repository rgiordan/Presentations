\def\deptspecific{I believe that the mission of the Mathematical Institute for
Data Science (MINDS) aligns closely with my research in statistical methodology
for large-scale, complex problems, as well as with my strong history of
interdisciplinary data science in both industry and academia.  My tenure as a
fellow in the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, my years of experience as an
engineer at Google, and my many research collaborations with domain experts from
both the physical and social sciences all demonstrate my capacity to advance the
MINDS institute's mission of developing fundamental principles to guide modern
data science. }
