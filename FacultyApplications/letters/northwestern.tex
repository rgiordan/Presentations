\def\position{Assistant Professor of Statistics at Northwestern University}

\def\deptspecific{I believe that the Northwestern University statistics
department's history of interdisciplinary work and increasing emphasis on data
science aligns closely with my own interdisciplinary research in statistical
methodology for large-scale, complex problems. Further, I believe that my tenure
as a fellow in the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, my work developing a
data science component for the UC Berkeley graduate curriculum, and my years of
experience as an engineer at Google will allow me to contribute meaningfully to
Northwestern University's new data science major.}
