\def\position{Assistant Professor of Data Science at Stanford University}

\def\deptspecific{The collaborative data science program at Stanford offers a
particularly exciting opportunity for me to continue my work of extracting
information from complex data in service of real-world problems. By working with
domain experts in astrometry, development economics, genomics, oceanography, and
more, my research has repeatedly derived generally applicable statistical tools
in the context of specific, collaborative scientific problems. Furthermore, my
engineering undergraduate degree, econometrics masters degree, and years of
industry experience offer a distinctively diverse background for collaborative
intellectual environments.  The opportunity to continue this work side-by-side
with some of the world's greatest scientists is exciting indeed.}
