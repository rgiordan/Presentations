\def\deptspecific{ I believe that my work on computational statistics and
machine learning, particularly my work developing variational methods for large
genomics datasets, together with my strong history of interdisciplinary
research, make the UCLA biostatistics department a
particularly good fit for me. The opportunity to contribute to a better world
through genomics and precision medicine is very exciting.}
