- Come up with a thesis

- Community creation
- Teaching is not the conveyance of information --- it is the creation of community
- Not "sage on a stage"
- Here is a thing you can do a community builder
- s / motivate / ownership / g

Teaching is not to impart knowledge but to create community
- Plan?  You need it for content
	- Content flow form student to teacher
	- Here's what a sage on stage might do and contrast


More consuluting --- it all counts as teaching, and these other things are more
community building.

These are future peers

- Drop pontification not anecdotes


Diversity: thesis statement
- Acting only in response to expressed felt need.  Set this up and everything
else addresses it.
