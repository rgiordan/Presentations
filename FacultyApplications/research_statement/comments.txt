- "circumstances that often obtain in..." -- grammar error here, I think? Or
- maybe archaic usage of "obtain"

- I feel like you jump into a specific example too quickly in the second
- paragraph. I kind of want your overall view of your research program here.
- Honestly I think a decent amount of the text in para 2 is fine, it's just that
- right now it's spun as "here's a paper i wrote"

- as part of the previous point, I think the microcredit example could be moved
- up to the end of the first paragraph to help motivate your research vision

- the first page is very focused on sensitivity analysis -- is there a broader
- view of your research goals? I'm kind of struggling to find words to describe
- my thoughts here...maybe something along the lines of the following:
- "sensitivity analysis" is a solution, and the writeup sounds like you have a
- hammer and you're looking for nails to hit. Or perhaps that's not the issue,
- but that "sensitivity analysis" is a really *specific* solution, and what I'm
- looking for is something more like "I develop techniques to achieve X", and
- the fact that it happens to be sensitivity analysis in your recent work is
- just a consequence of the problems you're tackling. Feel free to push back
- here, as you can tell my point is rather ill-defined ;)

- I wouldn't call it an "essay" -- perhaps just say "In the following I will
- discuss..."

- discrete BNP: this seems to focus on clustering -- you might have done that to
- simplify the text, which is fine, but perhaps worth mentioning that your work
- extends beyond this to other combinatorial trait models (assuming it does, of
- course!)

- "measurs" typo

- all of the other vignettes are awesome!

- Selected future: you need a stronger start to the section -- it reads right
- now like "iunno, i guess my collaborators will put me down some path or other"

- same comment as above (and same ill-formedness.... sorry!) -- too strong a
- focus on sensitivity analysis in particular here.

- "crossing my work" -- this doesn't read well. Basically, if I'm evaluating you
- as a potential prof, I am thinking "how is this going to play out over 5y?
- 10y? career?" -- saying that you'll combine existing papers (even if it's
- actually not a bad strategy in practice) sounds like this is all the research
- you're going to do for a bit and you're planning to just rehash your work a
- bunch in the near-term

- on the other hand, I really like that you mention designing projects for
- junior students. I would just try to spin this section to be a bit more
- forward-look

A few thoughts below, which are basically all on the theme of: don't assume your
reader is an expert in your topic, and don't assume they are going to read your
whole statement carefully. It's more likely they will read the first one or two
paragraphs, anything in bold, and first sentences or paragraphs of
(sub)sections. So write with that in mind. I like starting with this very
concrete problem, then showing how your methods help and might change the
results of important analyses. But I would recommend (i) delaying the details to
later so it's a single short paragraph that quickly gets to the punchline and
(ii) then going "big picture" about what your past research and future agenda
is, in very accessible language. This sentence is good to have in the first half
page: "I will discuss each of these applications, emphasizing the ways in which
I update classical results with intuitive, relevant theory and easy-to-use
computational tools." But I would rephrase to be more active.

***************
Something like:
"My research makes classical statistical ideas that were mostly used for
theoretical analysis relevant to modern practice by developing intuitive,
conceptually clear theory and easy-to-use computational tools scalable to large
datasets and complex models. I accomplish this by combining recent computational
advances like automatic differentiation, etc., etc."

Having a bulleted list with lots of text in each bullet is not very friendly to
people who are skimming quickly, and the bullets are pretty jargon-filled for an
introduction (bootstrap, Taylor expansion, bootstrap, MCMC, etc.). If you do
have a list at some point, I would definitely start each one with a bolded
summary sentence so it's easy to skim. The material on pages 2 and 3 would
benefit from some narrative, in which you divide your work into 2 or 3 "topics",
discuss why they are important, then go into details on specific projects on
each topic.

I would include (sub)section numbers, again to help the reader navigate
I wouldn't refer to it as an "essay"; maybe "statement" instead

I would delete the first qualifying sentence in your future work section â€“
you're not going to be held to what you write here. It's about showing that you
have the capability of developing a comprehensive research agenda. So, I would
instead start by making clear what are the questions motivating your proposed
future work: "I've done X and Y, but this naturally leads me to ask important
questions Z and Q."

From a cursory read -- it's a great start! Some high-level comments below

- The opening 2 paragraphs are too general. I think audiences unfamiliar with
- your work will get lost, esp. when you start talking about intuition about
- linear approximation. Better to start with a specific example (e.g. the of the
- Angelucci study) and reveal the problem (i.e. deleting some small subset
- changes the substantive conclusion). At that point, you're now set up to (i)
- say that researchers want to know whether results are sensitive; (ii) naively
- assessing sensitivity is computationally prohibitive; and (iii) that you
- provide computationally efficient and/or theoretically supported tools to
- facilitate such analyses.

- The line "my research shows that many standard, computationally demanding..."
- is great as is the line "I update classical results with intuitive relevant
- theory..." Combine the content of these sentences and you've got a really
- compelling "thesis" statement, which should appear in the first paragraph or
- section of the statement.

- This may be a matter of taste, but the bulleted outline feels a bit tacked on.
- One could argue, as well, that the line "For the remainder of this essay, ..."
- is an unnecessary invitation for the reader to stop reading! After making the
- compelling "thesis" statement, it's enough to say "In what follows, I describe
- some of my work in details before outlining new directions".

- This is also a matter of taste but calling out lead authorship parenthetically
- seems a bit tacky. The place to clarify authorship is in your CV. I've seen
- folks use asterisks, daggers, and assorted annotations to indicate lead
- authorship, alphabetical authorship, and authorship by supervised students. In
- the research statement, it just seems gratuitous. Using a plain numbered
- citation style eliminates the issue of appearing to cite excessively someone
- else's work.

- Speaking of citations: right now there are too many. Remember, this is not
- something that will appear publically. It's probably fine to state, without
- citation, "MFVB underestimates variance" or not cite Stan. The vast majority
- of readers are not going to follow-up any of the citations (e.g. by looking up
- Chapter 13.5 of Gelman & Hill).

- Your descriptions of individual contributions are, by themselves, quite
- well-written. But what's missing is a narrative throughline.

- In selected future works, I think the opening paragraph is a bit redundant and
- applies to every candidate.
