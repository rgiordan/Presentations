Good teaching does not only transfer knowledge, it creates intellectual
community---after all, university professors are cultivating future colleagues.
In an intellectual community, members are self-motivated, feedback facilitates
self-improvement rather than division, and information flows freely amongst all
members; analogously, good teachers contextualize course material within the
students' own interests, use assessment to allow students to monitor their own
progress and for the teacher to assess their own teaching, and help students
teach and learn from one another rather than acting as a ``sage on a stage.'' As
I elaborate in a series of vignettes below, I find that these themes of
motivation, feedback, and multi-directional communication recur and co-occur in
many of the successes from my years of being a teaching assistant at the
university level, as a full-time grade-school teacher in the Peace Corps, and as
a volunteer math teacher with the Prison University Project.

\paragraph{Motivating code quality.}
%
During my second year as a PhD student at UC Berkeley, I was asked by Prof.\ Bin
Yu to be her teaching assistant for the graduate-level course in applied
statistics.
% The course was organized around a number labs using real-life
% datasets, and my responsibilities were to give weekly lectures, hold office hours,
% and grade the written labs.
Prof.\ Yu asked me to add a reproducible research component to the course based
on my experience at Google, to which end I incorporated Github, code
readability, and unit testing into the lab requirements.

I quickly realized that simply lecturing on code readability and making it a
component of the grade was insufficient.   The students---who were otherwise
very highly motivated---simply did not see the importance of readability
enough to change bad habits.  To address this, I designed an in-class exercise
in which the students had to ``reproduce'' a simple analysis written by me.  In
my code, I deliberately and systematically violated all the code readability
guidelines I was trying to teach.  As a result, it was quite difficult to
understand what my analysis was doing.  To sweeten the pot, I put a small but
meaningful error in the code and challenged the students to find it.  The
students loved the puzzle-solving aspect of the assignment and, to my delight,
spent much of the hour complaining about my terrible style.  I had motivated the
students in a way they understood, and, following this assignment, the labs'
code readability improved considerably.

\paragraph{Evaluating in a way that accomodates multiple ability levels.}

Math teachers often have to accommodate a wide range of student abilities and
backgrounds, and my introductory statistics class at San Quentin University
through the Prison University Project (PUP) was particularly extreme in this
regard.  Some students had been at the top of their class when they were
younger, while others were very intelligent but had only learned basic
arithmetic as adults through PUP.  As a consequnce, I needed to design exercises
which accommodated this range of abilities and needs without leaving anyone
discouraged or bored.

My solution was to reduce the proportion of the class devoted to lectures and
increased the time available for individual or group work while I walked around
and answered questions.  I would design problem sets for such periods with the
expectation that \emph{no} student would be able to complete the whole thing in
the time allotted. In this way, the faster students could quickly proceed to
more challenging problems, while the slower students could spend more time with
concepts that were new to them without feeling ashamed of not completing the
full exercise set. When I found the same question was being asked repeatedly, I
would bring everyone together for a brief lecture on the question, and then
return to individual work.  By providing evaluation tasks that were
non-threatening and matched to students' ability levels, I helped create an
inclusive classroom environment, and got a lot of feedback for myself about the
effectiveness of my teaching as well.

\paragraph{Frequent and meaningful evaluation.}

When I was a teaching assistant for the graduate-level applied statistics
course, the students came from a wide array of technical backgrounds, from
statistics to psychology, and some students were little more than auditing,
while some wanted to work hard to push their own boundaries.  I expected that
some students would struggle with the material, and wanted to provide evaluation
that would be useful to all students.

I accomplished this goal in several ways. First, I made the rubric for grading
the labs as clear as possible, and allowed for a lab to be successful in many
different aspects, including clarity of exposition, quality of graphics,
analytical creativity, etc.  Next, I made sure that the students were
continually updated with their own progress and on the grade that they were
slated receive based on their performance to-date. Finally, I offered to give
detailed feedback on how to improve a particular lab if the students were
willing to spend time with me in person.  With the help of frequent and
substantive feedback, some of the students who began with the weakest
backgrounds went on to become some of the strongest by the end of the
class---and one such struggling student from outside statistics has even gone on
to become a professional data scientist.


\paragraph{Short questions during lecture.}

Most technical lectures have many points at which minor inferential steps can be
made into a short, minute-long exercise.  Whenever it is possible to get
feedback from the audience, I always build in such mini-exercises, which both
requires students to remain actively engaged and reveals if the exposition is
going too quickly.  In order to allow less vocal students to participate, one
can limit the number of questions per class that a given student can answer, or
one can call on the third hand to be raised rather than the first.

A particularly fun variant of this idea which I developed during the Peace Corps
is the ``deliberate mistake.''  I would warn my seventh-grade math students that
I was going to make a mistake in the next five minutes. The students would
instantly become  on the edge of their seat.  In their enthusiasm, they often
identified ``mistakes'' that were not actually mistakes, but every such instance
was still a valuable teaching moment.  By encouraging communication from the
students to myself, I was able to both motivate the students intrinsically and
evaluate for myself whether I was teaching effectively.

\paragraph{Two-way communication in statistical consulting.}

Statistical consulting, though not a classroom setting, is teaching-adjacent
venue in which two-way communication is particularly important. I have provided
statistical consulting services in many settings, including in the UC Berkeley
statistical consulting class, as a fellow in the Berkeley Institute of Data
Science, as a private contractor, and, for several years as a member of UC
Berkeley's chapter of the National Security Agency Statistical Advising Group
(NSASAG).  Rarely, I have found, does a petitioner actually ask a useful
statistical question at first, and a statistical consultant provides the most
value by actively encouraging the petitioner to explain to them the problem
motivation, not only its narrow statistical framing.

For example, as part of the NSASAG, we were asked how to compute low-rank
approximations of matrices with some given statistical properties.  Upon
pressing for more information about the motivation, I learned that all that was
actually needed was the computation of a t-statistic based on a linear form of a
high-dimensional parameter, which I saw could be computed exactly using the
conjugate gradient algorithm with no recourse to low-rank approximations.
Because I promoted two-way communication rather than simply attempting to convey
statistical knowledge, we were able to come to a much better solution that we
would have otherwise.


\paragraph{Be the teacher your students want, not the teacher you would want.}

As a third-year undergraduate, I was asked by my engineering department to be a
teaching assistant for the second-year class in statics, which was a required
course for most engineering majors.  Based on my own intellectual tastes at the
time, I spent my weekly lectures re-deriving the course material from a more
rigorous mathematical perspective in the form of assumptions and theorems.  This
being my first teaching role, I violated all of the above rules --- I did not
seek meaningful feedback from the students, I did not encourage students to work
together, and, most importantly, I considered only my own motivation and not
theirs.  As a consequence, it was not until I received teaching evaluations at
the end of the semester that I realized that the students had almost uniformly
wanted more intuition from the supplementary lectures, not more rigor.
Fortunately, this humbling experience set me on the long  and never-ending path
towards improving my teaching, leading to the more successful vignettes above.
