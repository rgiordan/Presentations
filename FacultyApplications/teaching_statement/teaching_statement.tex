Good teaching does not only transfer knowledge, it creates intellectual
community. At the university level community is particuarly important, since
professors are cultivating future colleagues.  In a poorly-taught classroom,
information flows only from teacher to student, assessment functions to separate
``good'' students from ``bad'', and the students' motivation is taken for
granted.  In a classroom built on intellectual community, the teacher actively
seeks feedback from the students and encourages the students to mentor one
another, assesment allows students to monitor their own progress and for the
teacher to assess their own teaching, and the teacher works to contextualize the
material within the students' interests.

I have been teaching throughout my adult life, and my experience has helped me
learn both how to create community and why it is valuable.
%
\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item I worked as a university-level teaching assistant both as an
    undergraduate in engineering and, as a PhD student, for the
    graduate-level applied statistics course. I received a university teaching
    award for my teaching at the graduate level.
%
    \item I was a full-time teacher for two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in
    Kazakhstan teaching math and English as a second language (ESL).  During
    this time, I wrote a math textbook in simple English for middle-school ESL
    students.  I also organized multiple extracurricular classes for my
    community in math, music, and pedagogy.
%
    \item As a PhD student, I volunteered for a year and a half teaching math
    courses, including statistics, to inmates at San Quentin prison with the
    Prison University Project (PUP).

\end{itemize}

Futhermore, many of my other professional activities, though not explicitly in a
classroom, have had a teaching component.  In these activities, community-based
thinking is as valuable as in the classroom.
%
\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item I have acted as a formal and informal mentor to numerous PhD students,
    both as part of the student mentorship program at UC Berkeley and as a
    postdoctoral researcher at MIT.  As a senior engineer at Google, I acted as
    an official mentor for several junior engineers and was the technical lead
    for a small research team.
%
    \item For most of my PhD, I organized and conducted my own reading group for
    any interested students on topics including variational Bayes, Bayesian
    non-parametrics, differential geometry, the bootstrap, and functional
    analysis.
%
    \item I have provided statistical consulting services in many settings,
    including in the UC Berkeley statistical consulting class, as a fellow in
    the Berkeley Institute of Data Science, as a private contractor, and, for
    several years as a member of UC Berkeley's chapter of the National Security
    Agency Statistical Advising Group (NSASAG).

\end{itemize}

For the remainder of the essay, I will describe instances when I was able to
enact the community-based practices of two-way communication, non-judgemental
feedback, and the cultivation of intrinsic motivation.


\paragraph{Cultivate intrinsic motivation.}
%
During my second year as a PhD student at UC Berkeley, I was asked by Prof. Bin
Yu to be her teaching assistant for the graduate-level course in applied
statistics.  The course was organized around a number labs using real-life
datasets, and my reponsibilties were to give weekly lectures, hold office hours,
and grade the written labs.  In addition, Prof. Yu asked me to add a
reproducible research component to the course based on my experience at Google,
to which end I incorporated Github, code readbility, and unit testing into the
lab requirements.

I quickly realized that simply teaching code readability and making it a
component of the grade was insufficient.   The students --- who were otherwise
very highly motivated --- simply did not see the importance of readability
enough to change bad habits.  To address this, I designed an in-class exercise
in which the students had to ``reproduce'' a simple analysis written by me.  In
my code, I deliberately and systematically violated all the code readbility
guidelines I was trying to teach.  As a result, it was quite difficult to
understand what my analysis was doing.  To sweeten the pot, I put a small but
meaningful error in the code and challenged the students to find it.  The
students loved the puzzle-solving aspect of the assignment and, to my delight,
spent much of the hour complaining about my terrible style.  Following this
assignment, the labs' code readability improved considerably.


\paragraph{Evaluate productively.}

Evaluating students' performance is a part of every classroom, but its role in a
community-based classroom is ideally productive and as non-threatening as
possible.

Useful evaluation is frequent, transparent, and conducted via many modalities.
When I taught in the Peace Corps, at PUP, and at UC Berkeley, as much as
possible I compute students' grades from many small projects rather than a few
large ones, let the students monitor their own progress, and based the grade on
many different modes of performance, including in-class participation, homework,
exams, and group work.  In this way, struggling students can ask for help early
and feel empowered to improve their grade; in the applied statistics course I
helped teach at UC Berkeley, some of the students who began with the weakest
backgrounds went on to become some of the strongest students through frequent
feedback and a lot of one-on-one help in office hours.

Math teachers often have to accomodate a wide range of student abilities and
backgrounds, and my introductory statistics class at San Quentin University
through the Prison University Project (PUP) was particularly extreme in this
regard.  Some students had been at the top of their class when they were
younger, some were very intelligent but had only learned basic arithmetic as
adults through PUP.  My goal was to design exercises which accomodated this
range of abilities and needs without leaving anyone discouraged or bored. To
this end, I reduced the proportion of the class devoted to lectures and
increased the time available for individual or group work while I walked around
and answered questions.  I would design problem sets for such periods with the
expectation that \emph{no} student would be able to complete the whole thing in
the time allotted. In this way, the faster students could quickly proceed to
more challenging problems, the slower students could spend more time with
concepts that were new to them. When I found the same question was being asked
repeatedly, I would bring everyone together for a brief lecture on the question,
and then return to individual work.  In this way, I helped create a classroom
environment that accomodated everyone's abilities, and got a lot of feedback
for myself about the students' progress.

\paragraph{Encourage multi-way communication.}

A teacher can learn from the students whether their teaching is effective, and
can even often gain valuable insights themselves when students interpret
material in new ways.  Futher, by evaluating each others' work, students
canderive motivation from their peers and build community amongs themselves.

Statistical consulting, though not a classroom setting, is teaching-adjacent
venue in which two-way communication is particularly important.  Rarely, I have
found, does a petitioner actually ask a useful statistical question at first,
and a statistical consultant provides the most value by first listening
carefully to the problem details.  For example, as part of the NSASAG, we were
asked how to compute low-rank approximations of matrices with some given
statistical properties.  Upon pressing for more information about the
motivation, I learned that all that was actually needed was the computation of
a t-statistic based on a linear form of a high-dimensional parameter, which I
saw could be computed exactly using the conjugate gradient algorithm with no
recourse to low-rank approximations.

It is crucial that a good teacher have a written lesson plan, but just as
crucial that they check regularly that students are keeping up with it. For
example, most technical lectures have many points at which minor inferential
steps can be made into a short, minute-long exercise.  When I gave my lectures
for the UC Berkeley applied statistics course, I built in explicit pauses for
the students to work out such exercises, which both required the students to
remain actively engaged and revealed if the exposition is going too quickly.
Similarly, when teaching at PUP, I found short, low-stakes, written in-class
quizzes at the beginning of class to be particularly effective at checking in on
students.
