% \item Even if the error $\red{\err(\w)}$ does not vanish,
%       it can still be small enough in practice.
%       \item[] ... Especially given the linear approximation's huge computational advantage!
% \item Our results strongly suggest inconsistency for the bootstrap in high dimensions as well.
% \item Are there consistent estimators?  \textbf{Open problem!}
