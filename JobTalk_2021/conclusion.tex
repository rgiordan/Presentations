\begin{frame}[t]{Other forms of robustness}

We proceeded as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Took presence of datapoints as a model input,
    \item Formed an automatically-computable differential approximation,
    \item Provided theory by analyzing higher-order derivatives,
    \item Studied its effectiveness in problems with open-access data.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Presence of datapoints is only one model input of many!}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prior sensitivity in Bayesian nonparametrics \citep{giordano2021bnp}
    \item Model sensitivity of MCMC output
        \citep{gustafson2000local, giordano2018covariances}
    \item Cross-validation \citep{giordano2019swiss, wilson:2020:cv}
    \item Cross-validation \citep{giordano2019swiss, wilson:2020:cv}
    \item Frequentist variances of MCMC posteriors (in progress)
\end{itemize}
