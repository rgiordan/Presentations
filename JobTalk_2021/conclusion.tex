\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item You may be concerned if you could reverse your conclusion by removing
a small proportion of your data.

\pause \item We can quickly and automatically find an approximate influential
set which is accurate for small sets.

\pause \item Data dropping robustness is principally determined by the
signal to noise ratio, and captures sensitivity distinct from sampling
and gross error sensitivity.

\end{itemize}
