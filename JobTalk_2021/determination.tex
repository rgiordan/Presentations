\begin{frame}{What makes an analysis sensitive?}

Suppose we are willing to drop $\alphan$ points.
%
We are ``sensitive to data dropping'' if, for some $\Delta$ large enough to
change our conclusions,
%
\begin{align*}
% $
%
\Delta < \thetafunlin(\w^*) - \thetafun(\thetahat)  =
    {\color{red}- \sum_{n=1}^{\lfloor \alpha N \rfloor} \infl_{(n)} }
    =:  {\color{red} \noise } { \color{red} \shape}
%
% $
\end{align*}
%
% \hspace{1em} where \vspace{1em}

\begin{itemize}
\item The ``noise'' $\noise^2 \rightarrow \mathrm{Var}(\sqrt{N}\phi)$
    ($\noise$ is the ``sandwich'' estimator)
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item $\noise^2 = $ is the robust ``sandwich'' variance estimator
    %     \citep{hampel1986robustbook}
    % \end{itemize}
\item The ``shape'' $\shape \le \sqrt{\alpha (1 - \alpha)}$
    converges to a nonzero constant
    % determined by $\infl_n$ distribution
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item $\shape$
    % \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]{Example.}

Report non-robustness if:
%
\begin{align*}
%
\thetafunlin(\w^*) - \thetafun(\thetahat)  = \noise \shape \ge \Delta
\quad\quad
\Leftrightarrow
\quad\quad
\frac{\Delta}{\noise} \le \shape.
%
\end{align*}
%
The \textbf{signal to noise ratio} $\frac{\Delta}{\noise}$
determines sensitivity to data dropping.

Let's analyze with $\alpha = 0.01 = 1\%$.
%
\begin{align*}
%
\begin{array}{rllrll}
\thetafun(\thetahat) ={}& -0.029  &\textrm{(Increase QOI by defn)}
    &   \Delta ={}& 0.029 \\
\noise ={}& 0.766 & \textrm{(Noise)}
        & \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \noise ={}& 0.005 &
        \textrm{(SE)} \\
\shape ={}& 0.046   &   \textrm{(Shape)}
    & \frac{1.96}{\sqrt{N}}  ={}& 0.0128
    & \rightarrow 0 \textrm{ as }N \rightarrow \infty\\
\shape \noise ={}& 0.035 & \textrm{(Data dropping sensitivity)}
    & \frac{1.96}{\sqrt{N}} \noise  ={}& 0.010
    & \textrm{(SE sensitivity)}\\
\end{array}
% %
\end{align*}
%
The noise is much larger than the signal $\Rightarrow$
Sensitive to data dropping.
