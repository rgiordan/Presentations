More data \& cheaper computation $\Rightarrow$\\
Statistical analyses are
playing larger roles in decision making.

\vspace{1em}
Decisions are important: We want \textbf{trustworthy} conclusions.\\
Data / models not always perfect: We want \textbf{robust} conclusions.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Gather + clean exchangeable data,
%     \item Specify and fit a model, and
%     \item Drawn a qualitative conclusion from your fit
%     \\(e.g., based on the sign / significance of
%         some estimated parameter).

\vspace{1em}
Would you be concerned if you could \textbf{reverse your conclusion} by removing
a \textbf{small proportion} (say, $0.1\%$) of your data?

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Running example:} \citet{angelucci2015microcredit}, a
randomized controlled trial study of the efficacy of microcredit based
on 16,560 data points.  \\We can reverse the studies qualitative
conclusions by removing $15$ observations ($< 0.1 \%$ of the data).

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{How do we find sets of influential points?}  Difficult in general!\\

\vspace{1em}
We provide a \textbf{automatic approximation} with finite-sample
guarantees.

Studying the approximation reveals the causes of non-robustness.

\begin{frame}{Dropping data: Mexico Microcredit}

Consider \citet{angelucci2015microcredit}, a randomized controlled trial study
of the efficacy of microcredit in Mexico based on 16,560 data points.

The variable ``Beta" estimates the effect of microcredit in US dollars.

The effect of microcredit is positive (negative) \&

By the end of the talk, we will see that the sensitivity is due to

\item High variability of the outcome (hosehold profit) relative to
\item A small signal driving the conclusion
(statistical significance)

Would you be concerned if you could \textbf{reverse your conclusion} by removing
a \textbf{small proportion} (say, $0.1\%$) of your data?

\pause
Not always!  But sometimes, surely yes.

Thinking without random noise can be helpful.

Suppose you have a farm, and want to know whether
your average yield is greater than 170 bushels per acre.
At harvest, you measure 200 bushels per acre.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Scenario one: If your yield is greater than 170 bushels
        per acre, you make a profit.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Donâ€™t care about sensitivity to small subsets
        \end{itemize}
    \item Scenario two: You want to recommend your farming
    methods to a friend across the valley.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Might care about sensitivity to small subsets
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For example, often in economics:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Small fractions of data are missing not-at-random,
\item Policy population is different from analyzed population,
\item We report a convenient summary (e.g. mean) of a complex effect,
\item Models are stylized proxies of reality.
\end{itemize}
