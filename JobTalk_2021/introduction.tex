\begin{frame}[t]{Dropping data: Mexico Microcredit}

% The success of statistics has led to data from particular populations
% being used increasingly to draw general conclusions.
% %
% Drawing the right conclusions affects peoples' lives!

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Example:} \citet{angelucci2015microcredit}, a randomized controlled
trial study of the efficacy of microcredit in Mexico based on 16,560 data
points.

The variable ``Beta" estimates the effect of microcredit in US dollars.

\begin{frame}{Dropping data: Motivation}

Would you be concerned if you could \textbf{reverse your conclusion} by removing
a \textbf{small proportion} of your data?

\vspace{1em}
Not always!  But sometimes, surely yes, especially when you want to
\textbf{generalize to unseen, systematically different populations}.

\vspace{1em}
Suppose you have a farm, and want to know whether
your average yield is $>$ 170 bushels per acre.
At harvest, you measure 200 bushels per acre.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Scenario one: $>$ 170 bushels
        per acre means you make a profit.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Donâ€™t care about sensitivity to small subsets.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Scenario two: Want to recommend methods to a distant friend.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Might care about sensitivity to small subsets!
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\vspace{1em}
Specifically, often in statistical applications:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Policy population is different from analyzed population,
\item Small fractions of data are missing not-at-random,
\item We report a convenient summary (e.g. mean) of a complex effect.
% \item Models are stylized proxies of reality.
\end{itemize}
