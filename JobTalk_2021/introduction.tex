\begin{frame}[t]{Dropping data: Mexico Microcredit}

% The success of statistics has led to data from particular populations
% being used increasingly to draw general conclusions.
% %
% Drawing the right conclusions affects peoples' lives!

\vspace{1em} \textbf{Example:} \citet{angelucci2015microcredit}, a randomized
controlled trial study of the efficacy of microcredit in Mexico based on $N =
$16,560 data points. A regression was run to estimate the average effect of
microcredit.

\hrulefill

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Original result: }
Treatment effect statistically insignificant at 95\%.

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Policy implication: } Disinvest in microcredit initiatives.

\hrulefill

\pause

\vspace{1em} \textbf{Data dropping: } Can produce both positive and negative
statististically significant results dropping no more than 15 data points
($<$ 0.1\%).

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Policy implication: } Run a higher-powered study (not just
larger $N$).

Cannot find influential subsets by brute force!

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{We provide a fast, automatic tool to  approximately identify the
most influential set of points.}

\begin{frame}{Dropping data: Motivation}

When do you care that you can \textbf{reverse your conclusion} by removing a
\textbf{small proportion} of your data?

\pause \vspace{1em} Not always!  But sometimes you surely do, especially when
you want to \textbf{generalize to unseen, systematically different populations}.

\vspace{1em}
Suppose you have a farm, and want to know whether
your average yield is $>$ 170 bushels per acre.
At harvest, you measure 200 bushels per acre.

\pause
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scenario one: $>$ 170 bushels
        per acre means you make a profit.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Donâ€™t care about sensitivity to small subsets.
        \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \item Scenario two: Want to recommend methods to a distant friend.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Might care about sensitivity to small subsets!
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\pause

\vspace{1em}
Specifically, often in statistical applications:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Policy population is different from analyzed population,
\item Small fractions of data are missing not-at-random,
\item We report a convenient summary (e.g. mean) of a complex effect.
% \item Models are stylized proxies of reality.
\end{itemize}
