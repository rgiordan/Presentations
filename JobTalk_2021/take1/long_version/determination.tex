Robustness is determined by a tail sum of the influence scores.

\begin{frame}{Corollaries.}
% Recall:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] $\Delta$  = The signal = The change in $\phi$ that would alter your conclusion
    \item[] $\hat\sigma_\phi$ = The noise = A consistent estimator of $\mathrm{Var}(\sqrt{N}\phi)$
    \item[] $\hat\Gamma_\alpha$ = The shape = Converges to a nonzero constant, $\le \sqrt{\alpha}$
\end{itemize}

Report non-robustness if the \textbf{``signal to noise ratio''}
$\frac{\Delta}{\hat\sigma_\phi} \le \hat\Gamma_\alpha$.

\pause

\textbf{Corollary:  Non-robustness possible even with correct specification.}
\vspace{-0.4em}
The noise $\hat\sigma_\phi$ may be larger than the effect
$\Delta$ you're trying to measure.

\pause
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Corollary:  Leave-$\lfloor \alpha N \rfloor$-out robustness does not vanish as $N \rightarrow \infty$.}
\vspace{-0.4em}

Both $\hat\Gamma_\alpha$ and $\hat\sigma_\phi$ typically converge to nonzero constants.

\pause
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Corollary:  Leave-$\lfloor \alpha N \rfloor$-out is different from standard errors.}
\vspace{-0.4em}

Standard errors reject when
$\frac{\Delta}{\hat\sigma_\phi} \le \frac{1.96}{\sqrt{N}} \ne \hat\Gamma_\alpha$.

\pause
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Corollary:  Insignificance is always non-robust.}
\vspace{-0.4em}

Take $\Delta = \frac{1.96 \hat \sigma_\phi}{\sqrt{N}}$.  We report
non-robustness when $\hat\Gamma_\alpha \ge \frac{1.96}{\sqrt{N}} \rightarrow 0$.
