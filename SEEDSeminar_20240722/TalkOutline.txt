Probability example of coin flipping.

Suppose that getting a heads is getting a good offer.  You only need one job offer.

- Candidate selection is highly random for everything (awards, scholarships, college admissions, jobs, dating)
- Don't eliminate yourself (flip a lot of coins)
- Don't take tails too seriously, and cultivate an environment where it's okay to flip tails

- Undergrad, applied to MIT, Cooper Union, Rice, UIUC.
- Got mediocre grades in undergrad
- Graduating, applied to many jobs, a friend recommended me for one
- Peace Corps
- For econ PhD, applied to Berkeley, MIT, Stanford, Wash U, masters at LSE, Harvard
- After master's applied to lots of finance jobs, only got one
- Randomly applied to Google, got very lucky, was totally underqualified, worked very hard
- Applied to PhD programs, got into Berkeley and Chicago
- Applied to fellowships, didn't get any
- Was going to leave academia, Tamara encouraged me to stay
- Applied for jobs, only got a couple, but that was enough.

In a way, I'm only squeaking by the admissions process by flipping a lot of coins.

But when I'm in, I seem to do a good job, and that leads people to see things in me
that I don't always see in myself.  That helps deal with the bad flips, and helps me
keep flipping.
