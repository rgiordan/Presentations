Weighting estimator diagnostics for







Calibration weighting--style diagnostics for nonlinear Bayesian hierarchical models


Multilevel Regression with Post-stratification (MrP) has become a workhorse
method for estimating population quantities using non-probability surveys, and
is the primary alternative to traditional survey calibration weights, e.g.~ as
computed by raking.  For simple linear regression models, MrP methods admit
``equivalent weights'', allowing for direct comparisons between MrP and
traditional calibration weights (Gelman 2006).  In the present work, we develop
a more general framework for computing and interpreting ``MrP local equivalent
weights'' (MrPlew), which admit direct comparison with calibration weights in
terms of important diagnostic quantities such as covariate balance, frequentist
sampling variability, and partial pooling.  MrPlew is based on a local
approximation, which we show in theory and practice to be accurate and
meaningful for the target diagnostics.  Importantly, MrPlew can be easily computed
based on existing MCMC samples and conveniently wraps standard MrP software
implementations.
