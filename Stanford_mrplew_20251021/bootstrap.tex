The weights can look very different! Does this mean anything?\\[1em]

% For example, \textbf{does the spread relate to frequentist variance?}

\onslide<2->{
\textbf{Yes:} The ``spread'' relates to frequentist variance just as in weighting estimators.\\

This is essentially a corollary of our earlier work on the Bayesian infinitesimal
jackknife.\footnote{See \textcite{giordano:2024:bayesij}. For weighting
variances, see, e.g.~, \textcite{deville:1993:generalizedraking,fuller:2011:sampling}.}
