\begin{frame}[t]{Frequentist variance estimation}


Let $\varemp{\cdot}$ denote the sample variance.

\begin{block}{Calibration weighting standard errors sketch:
    \footnote{E.g.~, \textcite{deville:1993:generalizedraking,fuller:2011:sampling}.}
}

If we have $\muhatcw = \surcol{\meansur \w_i \y_i}$ and a
consistent residual estimate $\surcol{\varepsilon_i}$, then

$$
\varemp{\surcol{\w_i \varepsilon_i}} \approx \var{}{\sqrt{\Nsur} \muhatcw}.
$$

\begin{block}{MrPlew Standard error consistency theorem sketch (Our contribution):\footnote{
This is essentially a corollary of our earlier work on the Bayesian infinitesimal jackknife.\footcite{giordano:2024:bayesij}
}}

For Bayesian hierarchical logictic regression, define
$\surcol{\varepsilon_i = \y_i - \expect{\post}{\m(\x_i^\trans \theta)}}$.
% \quad\textrm{and}\quad
% \surcol{\psi_i := \Nsur \w_i^\mrp \varepsilon_i}.

We state mild conditions under which, as $\Nsur \rightarrow \infty$,
for some $\tarcol{\mu_\infty}$ and variance $V$,
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \sqrt{\Nsur}\left(\muhatmrp - \tarcol{\mu_\infty} \right) \rightarrow{}&
    \mathcal{N}\left(0, V\right)
    \quad\textrm{ and }\\
    \varemp{ \surcol{\w_i^\mrp \varepsilon_i}}
%\surcol{\meansur (\psi_i - \overline{\psi})^2}
    \rightarrow{} V.
\end{aligned}
$$
\end{block}

\textbf{The use of $\surcol{\w_i^\mrp}$ is analogous to the use of $\surcol{\w_i}$
for frequentist variance estimation.}
