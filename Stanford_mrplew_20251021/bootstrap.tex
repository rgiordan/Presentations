\begin{frame}[c]{Standard error estimation}


Suppose we have $\muhatcw = \meantar \w_j \y_j$.


\begin{block}{Standard error consistency theorm: (sketch)}

For Bayesian hierarchical logictic regression, define
$$
\surcol{\varepsilon_i = \y_i - \expect{\post}{\m(\x_i^\trans \theta)}}
\quad\textrm{and}\quad
\surcol{\psi_i := \Nsur \w_i^\mrp \varepsilon_i}.
$$

We state mild conditions under which, as $\Nsur \rightarrow \infty$,
for some $\tarcol{\mu_\infty}$ and variance $V$,
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \sqrt{\Nsur}\left(\muhatmrp - \tarcol{\mu_\infty} \right) \rightarrow{}&
    \mathcal{N}\left(0, V\right)
    \textrm{ and }
\surcol{\meansur (\psi_i - \overline{\psi})^2} \rightarrow{}& V.
\end{aligned}
$$
\end{block}

The use of $\surcol{\w_i^\mrp}$ is exactly analogous to the use of raking weights
for standard error estimation.

This builds on our earlier work on the Bayesian
infinitesimal jackknife.\footcite{giordano:2024:bayesij}
