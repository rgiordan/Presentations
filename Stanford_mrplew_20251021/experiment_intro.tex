\begin{frame}{Real Data: Marital Name Change Survey}
Analysis of changing names after marriage\footnote{
    Based on \textcite{alexander:2019:namechange,cohen:2019:namechange,ipumsusa}.}.

\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item \textbf{Target population:} ACS survey of US population 2017--2022
    \item \textbf{Survey population:} Marital Name Change Survey (from Twitter)
    \item \textbf{Respose:}  Did the female partner keep their name after marriage?
    \item For regressors, use bins of age, education, state, and decade married.
    %
\end{itemize}

MrP computed with \texttt{brms} \parencite{brms}:\\

\texttt{kept\_name $\sim$ (1 | age\_group) + (1 | educ\_group) + (1 | state\_name) + (1 | decade\_married)}

CW used raking on coarsened regressor marginals ({\small{\texttt{survey::calibrate}}} from \textcite{lumley:2025:survey})
