Analysis of national support for gay marriage.\footnote{Based on \textcite{kastellec:2010:laxmrp},
see also \textcite{lax:2009:gay}.}

\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item \textbf{Target population:} US Census Public Use Microdata Sample 2000
    \item \textbf{Survey population:} Combined national-level polls from 2004
    \item \textbf{Respose:}  ``Do you favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally?''
    \item For regressors, use race, gender, age, education, state, region,
        and continuous statewide religion and political characteristics, including
        some analyst--selected interactions.
