We'll be comparing (frequentist) p-values with Bayesian model selection
in a particularly simple setting: testing a point null against a composite
alternative with a scalar parameter.

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is a p-value?
    \item What is Bayesian model selection?
    \item Are they commensurable?  (No)
    \item What now?
\end{itemize}

This is the offical position of the American Statistical Association.

Its executive director writes:

\vspace{1em}

\begin{quote}
``Don’t believe that your p-value gives the probability that chance alone
produced the observed association or effect or the probability that your test
hypothesis is true.  ... Don’t conclude anything about scientific or practical
importance based on statistical significance (or lack thereof).  Don’t. Don’t.
Just...don’t.''  \citep{wasserstein:2019:beyondp}
