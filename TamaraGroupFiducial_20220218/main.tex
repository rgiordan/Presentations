\begin{frame}{Are confidence intervals inference?}

Suppose we have a scalar parameter $\theta$, a random variable $X$ with unknown
distribution $\p{\cdot}$, and an interval-valued function $x \mapsto C(x)$ such
that, no matter the distribution of $X$, we know that
%
\begin{align*}
%
\p{\cover = 1} = 0.9
\quad\textrm{ where}\quad
\cover := \ind{\theta \in C(X)}
\quad\textrm{(}\cover\textrm{ is for ``cover'')}\quad
%
\end{align*}
%
The interval $C(X)$ is a {\em valid confidence interval} for $\theta$. This
means that if we act as if $\theta \in C(X)$, we will be wrong at most $10\%$ of
the time.

\pause

\hrulefill

When is it reasonable to interpret $\cover$ {\em inferentially}, saying
that, when we observe $X=x$, that we subjectively believe that $\theta \in C(x)$
with $90\%$ certainty?

\pause
Not always!
Recall, for example, how we can construct silly confidence
intervals. Augment the data with a draw $Z \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0, 1)$, and let
%
\begin{align*}
%
C(X) =
\begin{cases}
    (-\infty, \infty) & \textrm{ when } Z \le 0.9 \\
    [1337, 1337] & \textrm{ otherwise }
\end{cases}.
%
\end{align*}
%
Obviously, no matter what the generating process, $\p{\cover = 1} = 0.9$,
but it is absurd to assert that we are $90\%$ confident that
$\theta = 1337$ because we observed $Z = 0.95$.

\pause

How can we characterize generally and precisely what went wrong?

\begin{frame}{A pathological confidence interval}

Write beliefs as $\b{\cdot}$, to contrast with aleatoric
probabiliites $\p{}$. So we ask when
%
\begin{align*}
%
\p{\cover = 1} = 0.9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad
\b{\cover = 1 | X = x} = 0.9
%
\end{align*}

\pause

\hrulefill

Note that Bayesians define priors and completely specified
data generating processes and insist that $\b{} = \p{}$.

Certainly that suffices.  But is it necessary?

\pause

It is often difficult to plausibly specify
everything needed for Bayes.  In such cases it can be hard to
assert that $\b{} = \p{}$.

\pause

We may also want to trade off mathematical or computational effort to achieve
$\b{} \approx \p{}$.  Bayes gives no real guidance for doing so.

\pause

I argue that potential answers may be found in the (nowadays largely discarded)
approaches of {\em fiducial inference}.

Here, I will follow the treatment from Ian Hacking's book, {\em The Logic of
Statisical Inference}.

\begin{frame}{Fiducial inference for confidence intervals}

Fiducial inference for confidence intervals requires three key assumptions.
The first two are uncontroversial:

\textbf{The logic of support:}  Formally, $\b{}$ obeys Kolmogorov's axioms. For
example, if proposition $A$ and $B$ are mutually incompatible, then $\b{A | B} =
0$.  If $B$ provides no information about $A$, then $\b{A | B} = \b{A}$.
If $B \Rightarrow A$, then $\b{A | B} = 1$.  And so on.

The logic of support is needed to even write and manipulate $\b{\cdot}$.

\pause

\textbf{The frequency principle:}  If $\p{X}$ is known, then our
subjective beliefs correspond with aleatoric probabilities.  That is,
$\b{X = x} = \p{X = x}$.

\pause

The third is where things can go wrong for confidence intervals.

\textbf{Irrelevance:} The precise value of the data $X=x$ is not  subjectively
informative about whether $\theta \in C(x)$.  That is,
%
\begin{align*}
%
\b{\theta \in C(x) | X = x} = \b{\theta \in C(x)}.
%
\end{align*}
%

\pause

Using these three assumptions, confidence
intervals are valid inference:
%
\begin{align*}
%
\b{\theta \in C(x) | X = x} &= \b{\theta \in C(x)}
    & \textrm{Irrelevance}\\
&= \p{\theta \in C(X)}
    & \textrm{The frequency principle}\\
&= 0.9
& \textrm{Construction of }C(\cdot).
%
\end{align*}
%
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The pathological example is caught}

\textbf{Irrelevance:} The precise value of the data $X=x$ is not  subjectively
informative about whether $\theta \in C(x)$.  That is,
%
\begin{align*}
%
\b{\theta \in C(x) | X = x} = \b{\theta \in C(x)}.
%
\end{align*}
%

Recall our pathological example:

\begin{align*}
%
C(x) =
\begin{cases}
    (-\infty, \infty) & \textrm{ when } z \le 0.9 \\
    [1337, 1337] & \textrm{ otherwise }
\end{cases}.
%
\end{align*}
%

Our pathological example fails the principle of irrelevance, since
knowing $z \ge 0.9$ is very informative about whether $\theta \in C(x)$.

\begin{frame}{How to use this?}

The {\em invalidity} of a confidence interval can be demonstrated by an ability
to predict $\mathbb{I}(\theta \in C(x))$ from $x$.

\pause

Given a candidate confidence interval, constructed using any method, this
renders the validity of inference {\em quantitatively falisifiable}, e.g.
through simulation and machine learning.

\pause

It also admits {\em degrees of valid inference}, e.g. in the sense that
$\mathbb{I}(\theta \in C(x))$ may be only slightly
predictd by $x$.

\pause

Computation of $C(x)$ and predictability of $\mathbb{I}(\theta \in C(x))$
can in principle be explicitly traded off against one another.

\pause

\textbf{I think this is very exciting.}
