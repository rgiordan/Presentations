\newcommand{\EoneNumObs}{1,000}


We generated $\EoneNumObs$ observations.  They looked like a mess,
as you can see in \figref{eone_scatter}.


\begin{knitrout}
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{figure}[!h]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.980\linewidth,height=0.784\linewidth]{figure/eone_scatter-1} 

}

\caption[It's nice to have a long figure caption that allows easy access to latex stuff like there were $\EoneNumObs$ draws of $x$ and $\epsilon$ that went into this plot]{It's nice to have a long figure caption that allows easy access to latex stuff like there were $\EoneNumObs$ draws of $x$ and $\epsilon$ that went into this plot.}\label{fig:eone_scatter}
\end{figure}

And \figref{eone_hist} as well.  What garbage.
