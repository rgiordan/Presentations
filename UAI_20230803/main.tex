\begin{frame}{Discussion of ``The Shrinkage-Delinkage Trade-off''}

Variational inference (VI) finds
$q^* := \argmin_{\q \in \qdom} \kl{\q}{\p}$ for an unknown target $\p$.
%
% \begin{align*}
% %
% %
% \end{align*}
%

What should $\qdom$ be?

\pause

Classical VI takes a simple $\qdom$. Then $\p \notin \qdom$, but 
you get computational benefits!

\pause

But when $\p \notin \qdom$, can get poor posterior approximations even in simple
cases.  

What to do?

\pause
%
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Don't care (``machine learning'')
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluate by other criteria than
    poterior approximations (e.g. prediction)
    \item Maybe fine for some machine learning tasks
\end{itemize}
%
\pause
\item Make $\qdom$ more expressive (``modern VI'')
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong theoretical guarantees
    \item High computational cost!
\end{itemize}
\pause
%
\item Try to capture important properties of $\p$ with simple $\qdom$
% \item Understand how simple $\qdom$ fails for things we care about
%
\begin{itemize}
    % \item We don't actually want the whole posterior
    \item Begins with understanding how things go wrong (\textbf{this paper}!)
    \item Hope to have our cake and eat it too (e.g. marginals \emph{and} easy computation)
    \item Much harder!  But important, with big potential benefits
\end{itemize}
%
\end{enumerate}
%

I would love to see more work like this!
