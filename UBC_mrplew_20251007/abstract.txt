Local Weighting--Based Diagnostics for Bayesian Poststratification

Multilevel Regression with Post-stratification (MrP) has become a workhorse
method for estimating population quantities using non-probability surveys, and
is the primary alternative to traditional survey calibration weights, e.g.~ as
computed by raking.  For simple linear regression models, MrP methods admit
``equivalent weights'', allowing for direct comparisons between MrP and
traditional calibration weights (Gelman 2006).  In the present paper, we develop
a more general framework for computing and interpreting ``MrP approximate
weights'' (MrPaw), which admit direct comparison with calibration weights in
terms of important diagnostic quantities such as covariate balance, frequentist
sampling variability, and partial pooling.  MrPaw is based on a local equivalent
weighting approximation, which we show in theory and practice to be accurate.
Importantly, MrPaw can be easily computed based on existing MCMC samples and
conveniently wraps standard MrP software implementations.  We illustrate our
approach for several canonical studies that use MrP, including for the binary
outcome of vote choice, showing a high degree of variability in the performance
of MrP models in terms of frequentist diagnostics relative to raking.
