- "Peter Kedron is a human geographer and GIScientist"
- Dr Peter Kedron is an Associate Professor of Geography at the University of
California Santa Barbara and core faculty in the Center for Spatial Studies and
Data Science. 
- PhD in geography from State University of New York, MA in economics, BAs in economics and psychology
- He develops analytical methods, research approaches, and
pedagogical models to build a reproducible and reliable spatial data science.
- Recent work focuses on the use of replication as a means of evaluating geographic research
- And on developing statistical approaches to improve the accumulation of evidence collected from 
different locations.
- His recent research focuses on bringing a geographic approach to understanding
not only what policies work, but what policies work where.
