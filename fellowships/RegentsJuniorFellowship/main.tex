I propose to spend the summer of 2024 working on two collaborative research
projects.  The first, ``neural network classifiers for Bayesian posteriors,''
promises to introduce a completely new set of Bayesian inference techniques with
different computational tradeoffs than existing methods. The second,
``black--box computable diagnostic weights for survey sampling,'' will bring a
much--needed set of diagnostic tools to the vast majority of modern applied
survey sampling.  These two projects are different in scope --- the first
represents ground--breaking methodological research, and the second an
application of my existing research to an urgent applied problem --- but each
rests on and contributes to my existing work on approximate Bayesian computation
and sensitivity analysis.
